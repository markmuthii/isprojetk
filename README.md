# Is PROJE.Tk

This repos holds the code for [http://isproje.tk](http://isproje.tk).

It contains code for a functioning user authentication system, complete with email confirmation.

## Getting started

To use it, clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/markmuthii/isprojetk
```

Open the project in your favourite text editor. I like sublime text:

```
subl .
```

Change the configurations found in ```db/config.php``` to your server settings and upload the folder contents to your root directory in the server. 

Import the sql file found in the ```mysql/``` to your database, and enjoy.

If you run into any issues, reach out on Twitter [@muthiimm](https://twitter.com/muthiimm).

I use [000Webhost](000webhost.com) for testing. For a more reliable hosting provider, I recommend [Bluehost](https://markmuthii.com/go/bluehost) _(affiliate link)_, whose hosting packages come with a free domain.
